            <h1>How Would You Feel (Paeaen)</h1>
            <br>
            <h2>Verse 1</h2>
                <p>You are the one <span class="lore" title="boy">girl</span>
                <br> And you know that it's true
                <br> I'm feeling younger
                <br> Every time that I'm alone with you 
                </p>
            <h2>Pre-Chorus</h2>
                <p>
                <br> We were sitting in a parked car
                <br> Stealing kisses in the front yard
                <br> We got questions we should not ask but</p>
            <h2>Chorus</h2>
                <p>
                <br> <span>How would you feel, if I told you I loved you?</span>
                <br> It's just something that I <span class="lore" title="wanted">want</span> to do
                <br> I'll be taking my time, spending my life
                <br> Falling deeper in love with you
                <br> <span> tell me that you love me too</span>
                </p>
            <h2>Verse 2</h2>
                <p>
                <br> In the summer, as the lilacs bloom
                <br> Love flows deeper than the river
                <br> Every moment that I spend with you
                </p>
            <h2>Pre-Chorus</h2>
                <p>
                <br> We were sat upon our best friend's roof
                <br> <span>I had both of my arms round you</span>
                <br> Watching the sunrise replace the moon
                </p>
            <h2>Chorus</h2>
                <p>
                <br> <span>How would you feel, if I told you I loved you?</span>
                <br> It's just something that I want to do
                <br> I'll be taking my time, spending my life
                <br> Falling deeper in love with you
                <br> <span> tell me that you love me too</span>
                </p>
